# Forest Fire Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood and severity of forest fires based on environmental and meteorological data. By using historical data and advanced algorithms, the project aims to aid in early detection and prevention of forest fires.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from raw datasets.
- **Prediction Model**: A trained machine learning model to classify and predict forest fire occurrences.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of key metrics, such as temperature, humidity, and fire probability.
- **Deployment Ready**: The model is designed for integration with web or mobile applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks (as applicable)
- **Deployment Tools**: Flask/Django (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
