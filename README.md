# Forest Fire Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques in **R** to predict the likelihood and severity of forest fires based on environmental and meteorological data. The aim is to assist in early detection and prevention strategies for forest fire management.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation of raw datasets.
- **Prediction Model**: Machine learning algorithms trained to classify and predict forest fire occurrences.
- **Visualization**: Static and interactive visualizations for insights into data and predictions.
- **Reproducibility**: Code and results are reproducible across environments using R packages.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `caret`, `randomForest`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `shiny` (optional for deployment)
- **Modeling**: Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-prediction.git
